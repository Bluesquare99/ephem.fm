be guided through indie stations

Welcome! 

This project is still taking shape, but it is a site to discover and peruse indie radio stations from around the world!  
This repo contains a basic UI which can be accessed at https://naughty-ride-d3cf56.netlify.app 

I'm also creating tools to hook into Spotify's Web Development API which allows you to get stats including danceability and popularity of tracks.
I will use these to create profiles of stations to allow users to better sift through and find those that are similar to their tastes or different, 
if they'd like a challenge ðŸ˜‰ .  That repo (also in progress) may be found at https://github.com/Bluesquare99/radio-analysis-tools 

If you're a visual artist or digital designer and would like to collaborate on this experience, please email me at msmccready@gmail.com
